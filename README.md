# Using Machine Learning To Predict Decisions on EEG Data
This repository consists of the data used and the code written by Sukhleen Kaur during her Bachelor Project. The aim of this project was to classify EEG data using machine learning techniques to determine whether decisions can be predicted or not.

The coding was done in Python 3 using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and is provided as a set of Jupyter Notebooks.

This repository consists of 4 directories:
* [**Data**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/bachelor_project/tree/master/Data): contains EEG data of 15 participants in .mat files
* [**src**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/bachelor_project/tree/master/src): contains the codes for classifiers (LDA, SVM with RBF Kernel and SVM with Polynomial Kernel) and data visualizations
* [**CSV_Files(Outputs)**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/bachelor_project/tree/master/CSV_Files(Outputs)): contains the CSV files which were retrieved through the coding for the purpose of analysis
* [**Images_and_Graphs**](https://github.com/sukhleen-kaur/bachelor_project/tree/master/Images_and_Graphs): contains images and graphs to visualize performance of the classifiers (ROC curves, confusion matrices, bar plots) which were extracted from the Jupyter Notebooks
