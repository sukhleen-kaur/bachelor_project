# Using Machine Learning To Predict Decisions on EEG Data
This repository consists of the data and code used by Sukhleen Kaur during her Bachelor Project. The aim of this project was to apply classify EEG data using machine learning techniques to determine whether decisions can be predicted or not.

The coding was done in Python 3 using [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and is provided as a Jupyter Notebook.

This repository consists of 4 directories:
*Data: contains EEG data of 15 participants in .mat files
*Code: contains the codes for classifiers and data visualizations as .ipynb
*CSV_Files(Outputs): the CSV files which were retrieved through the coding for analysis
*Images_and_Graphs: images and graphs to visualize performance of the classifiers (ROC curves, confusion matrices, bar plots)
